They go like this throughout the night, until Araft falls asleep.
Eventually, sleep takes them all, the boat a little quieter.

As you sit up, you think about life.
You think about what you did to these people.
You wonder if they'd ever forgive you, if they knew.
It was you who destroyed the ship.

A great voice speaks from the heavens. It is the voice of God.
Its cruel joke is unknown to the rats.
The kitten recognises just a little of it.
And so do you.
It says that the experiment was a complete success.
It says there were only minimal fatalities.
One of them is annoyed that Chester got in with the rats again.
And as great hands reach down to pluck you all from the boat...
Cheddar clings on to her daughter.
But they take her away.
Only you are left in the tank.
Only you are left, to take the next rats to meet their maker.
Only you are left, with the lapping of the waves.
